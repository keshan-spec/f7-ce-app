                  <h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>
                  <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
                  <p>1.1 Car Events Ltd. (“CarEvents.com”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a company registered in England and
                    Wales under company
                    number 12698619, with registered offices at The Motorist Lennerton Lane, Sherburn In Elmet, Leeds,
                    England, LS25
                    6JE.</p>
                  <p>1.2 We operate an online and mobile App service where you can search for and purchase car show and
                    related event
                    tickets. No tickets are sold by us, we simply facilitate the sale process via a direct link to the
                    show organiser’s
                    Stripe and/or Paypal accounts.</p>
                  <p>1.3 This “Purchase Policy” sets out the terms and conditions applicable to purchases of Tickets via
                    any of the
                    CarEvents.com platforms. If you are making a purchase online, this Purchase Policy also incorporates
                    our website
                    Terms of Use.</p>
                  <p>1.4 We promote the sale of Tickets and associated products and services on behalf of event
                    organisers, promoters,
                    venues, car clubs and other persons involved in the organisation of events (“Event Partner(s)”).
                    Please note that we
                    are not responsible for organising or delivering the events themselves.</p>
                  <p>1.5 It is the responsibility of the Event Organisers to set the number and type of Tickets
                    available via the
                    CarEvents.com online organiser dashboard tool on an event by event basis.</p>
                  <p>1.6 We promote the sale of Tickets from numerous online interfaces (desktop, mobile website and
                    app). All of our
                    interfaces access the same ticketing system and ticket inventory, therefore Tickets for popular
                    events may sell-out
                    quickly. Occasionally, additional Tickets for sold-out events may become available prior to events.
                    However, we do
                    not control Ticket inventory or its availability.</p>
                  <p>1.7 We can’t offer any exchanges or refunds if the event is going ahead on the date originally
                    planned. If the date
                    of an event is changed, your tickets will be transferred to the new date. If the date does change,
                    you may request a
                    refund by emailing the event organiser directly (within a minimum of 14 days before the event takes
                    place). Refunds
                    are not guaranteed and are at the event organiser’s discretion.</p>
                  <p>1.8 Nothing in this Purchase Policy affects your statutory rights as a consumer. For further
                    information about your
                    statutory rights, please contact Citizens Advice.</p>
                  <p>1.9 We act solely as the event orgnaiser’s fulfilment partner and are not responsible for any
                    aspects of your
                    purchase from the event partner, save for delivery of tickets to you. If you have any queries or
                    complaints
                    regarding your purchase of tickets from any of our event partners or other third parties, please
                    contact them
                    directly.</p>

                  <p>2.3 If you are making purchases on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and

                    refer and apply to that company or other legal entity).</p>
                  <p>2.4 Please refer to our Privacy Notice and Cookies Policy for more details on how we use and

                    fully with our
                    requests for information about you and your purchases.</p>
                  <p>2.5 You must not create or use multiple accounts with the purpose or intention of circumventing any
                    of the terms of
                    this Purchase Policy or concealing your identity or other personal details.</p>
                  <p>2.6 You must not use our website or app, your account and/or any of our related services (together
                    the “CE

                    have used or are
                    using or attempting to use the CE Services in such a way that a criminal offence has been, is being
                    or might be
                    committed, we are required by law to report your identity and details of such activity to the
                    relevant authorities
                    (and any relevant Event Partner).</p>
                  <p>2.7 We reserve the right to terminate your account and/or cancel any of your orders and/or prohibit
                    you from making
                    future orders or using the CE Services in future if:</p>
                  <p>(a) any abusive or threatening behaviour is carried out by you or on your behalf or via your
                    account;</p>
                  <p>(b) we suspect any fraudulent activity or other illegal activity is carried out by you or on your
                    behalf or via
                    your account;</p>

                    by you or on your
                    behalf or via your account;</p>
                  <p>(d) we are ordered to do so by any legal or regulatory authority; and/or</p>

                  <p>2.8 You may close your account by emailing members@carevents.com. However, please note that such
                    closure shall not

                  <p>2.9 Termination of your account and/or cancellations of any purchases under this Purchase Policy
                    shall not affect
                    our or your rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to and including the date of such
                    termination or
                    cancellation.</p>

                  <p><strong>LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT</strong></p>
                  <p>3.1 In order to make a purchase from us or any of our event partners, you must be at least 18 years
                    old (or the age
                    of legal capacity in the country of purchase) and able to enter into legally binding contracts. If
                    you are
                    purchasing online, you must also have a CarEvents.com account and a valid credit or debit card
                    issued in your name.
                  </p>
                  <p>3.2 Any purchase from us or our event partners forms a legally binding contract that is subject to:
                    (i) this
                    Purchase Policy; (ii) any special terms and conditions stated to be applicable to a ticket and/or
                    event; (iii) other
                    terms and conditions of the Event Partner(s) and/or event; and (iv) any venue terms and conditions
                    (including
                    conditions of entry). You should read this Purchase Policy carefully before you make a purchase.</p>
                  <p>3.3 By purchasing one or more Items from us or our event partners, you acknowledge that you have
                    read, understood
                    and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Purchase Policy. If you do not agree with
                    this Purchase
                    Policy or any other applicable terms and conditions, or if you cannot comply with any of them, then
                    you must not
                    make a purchase.</p>
                  <p>3.4 We reserve the right from time to time to make changes to this Purchase Policy. Where we make
                    any such changes,
                    we shall post the updated version of this Purchase Policy on our website. Therefore, we recommend
                    you check this
                    Purchase Policy regularly to stay informed of its current terms and conditions. All purchases are
                    subject to the
                    applicable version of this Purchase Policy that was published at the time of purchase. If you do not
                    agree with any
                    revised version of this Purchase Policy, or if you cannot comply with it, then you must not make a
                    purchase.</p>

                  <p><strong>PRICES, PAYMENT AND PLACING ORDERS</strong></p>
                  <p>4.1 Accepted methods of payment include Paypal, Visa and MasterCard debit or credit cards (via
                    Stripe)</p>
                  <p>4.2 Your contract for purchase starts once we have confirmed your order and ends immediately after
                    completion of
                    the event for which you have purchased Item(s).</p>
                  <p>4.3 If you do not receive an order confirmation after submitting payment information, or if you
                    experience an error
                    message or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to
                    confirm via your
                    CarEvents.com account or contacting the Event Partner whether or not your order has been placed.
                    Only you may be
                    aware of any problems that may occur during the purchase process. We will not be responsible for any
                    costs or losses
                    you incur if you assume that an order was or was not placed because you failed to receive an order
                    confirmation.</p>
                  <p>4.4 All purchases are subject to credit or debit card verification (if applicable), other security
                    checks. Your
                    order may be cancelled if it has not passed the relevant verification process or if payment is not
                    received in full.
                    In rare circumstances, if your payment is recalled by the associated bank or payment provider, we
                    reserve the right
                    to cancel and refund any order for which an order confirmation has been sent. We accept no
                    responsibility or
                    liability for such cancellations, as these are outside our control.</p>
                  <p>4.5 It is prohibited to obtain or attempt to obtain any Items through unauthorised use of any
                    robot, spider or
                    other automated device or software, or through unauthorised framing or linking to any website, or
                    through any other
                    illegal or unauthorised activity. We reserve the right to cancel any orders that we reasonably
                    suspect to have been
                    made in breach of this Purchase Policy, without any notice to you, and any and all Items obtained as
                    part of such
                    orders will be void.</p>
                  <p>4.6 To prevent fraud and protect us, we reserve the right to carry out checks and/or request that
                    additional
                    information be provided in order to verify purchases. We reserve the right to cancel any orders that
                    we reasonably
                    suspect to have been made fraudulently, without any notice to you, and any and all Items obtained as
                    part of such
                    orders will be void.</p>
                  <p>4.7 Please ensure that you read the full Item description details and are happy with your selection
                    prior to
                    purchase as we may be unable to rectify issues arising as a result of your mistake.</p>

                  <p><strong>DELIVERY</strong></p>
                  <p>6.1 All CarEvents.com tickets are supplied as an e-delivery, you are responsible for either (i)
                    ensuring that you
                    log in to your CarEvents.com account and download your Tickets in good time prior to the event; or
                    (ii) providing a
                    valid email address for e-delivery of Tickets and ensuring that you are able to receive delivery of
                    the Tickets by
                    email (for example by ensuring that your email mailbox does not reject, bounce or otherwise prevent
                    any relevant
                    emails from being delivered, and by checking your email mailbox regularly (including junk or spam
                    folders).</p>

                  <p><strong>TICKET RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>
                  <p>8.1 Any Ticket you purchase via CE Services remains the property of the relevant Event Partner and
                    is a personal
                    revocable licence which may be withdrawn, and admission refused, at any time.</p>

                  <p><strong>TICKET RESTRICTIONS</strong></p>
                  <p>9.1 When purchasing Tickets from an Event Partner, you are limited to a specified number of Tickets
                    for each event.
                    This number is included on the first purchase page and is verified with every order. This policy is
                    in effect to
                    discourage and prevent unfair ticket buying practices. Tickets may be restricted to a maximum number
                    per person (or
                    business, as applicable), per credit or debit card and, for some events or tours, a restriction may
                    apply per
                    household as well. We reserve the right to cancel any order(s) for Tickets purchased in excess of
                    the relevant
                    limits without notice.</p>
                  <p>9.2 Tickets may be sold subject to certain restrictions on entry or use, such as a minimum age for
                    entry. Any such
                    restrictions will be displayed or otherwise notified to you before or at the time of booking. It is
                    your
                    responsibility to ensure that you read all notifications and other important information displayed
                    or notified to
                    you as part of the purchase process. We will not be responsible if you or any guests under your
                    booking are refused
                    admission because of a failure to meet or prove that you/they meet any restrictions (e.g. a minimum
                    age
                    requirement).</p>
                  <p>9.3 You are not entitled to purchase any Tickets as a trader acting in the course of business with
                    the intention of
                    reselling your Tickets for profit unless formal written permission is given by us and the relevant
                    Event Partner in
                    advance. If we discover or have reason to suspect that you have purchased and intend to resell, or
                    have sold Tickets
                    in breach of this clause, we reserve the right to cancel your Tickets without notice.</p>
                  <p>9.4 You may not resell or transfer your Tickets if prohibited by law. In addition, Event Partners
                    may restrict or
                    prohibit the resale or transfer of tickets for some events. Any resale or transfer (or attempted
                    resale or transfer)
                    of a ticket in breach of the applicable law or any restrictions or prohibition imposed by an Event
                    Partner is
                    grounds for seizure or cancellation of that Ticket.</p>
                  <p>9.5 Tickets purchased from us may not:</p>
                  <p>(a) be used for advertising, promotions, contests or sweepstakes (or for other such similar
                    commercial gain);
                    and/or</p>
                  <p>(b) be combined with any hospitality, travel or accommodation service and/or any other merchandise,
                    product or
                    service to create a package for sale or other distribution,</p>
                  <p>unless formal written permission is given by us and the relevant Event Partner in advance and
                    provided that even if
                    such permission is granted, use of our or any Event Partner’s trade marks and other intellectual
                    property is subject
                    to the express prior written consent of the owner.</p>

                  <p><strong>EVENT TIMINGS AND ADMISSIONS</strong></p>
                  <p>10.1 Please note that advertised start times of events are subject to change.</p>
                  <p>10.2 Tickets are sold subject to the Event Partner’s right to alter or vary the programme of an
                    event due to events
                    or circumstances beyond its reasonable control without being obliged to refund monies or exchange
                    tickets, unless
                    such change is a material alteration as described in clause 11, in which case the provisions of that
                    clause shall
                    apply.</p>
                  <p>10.3 Generally, every effort to admit latecomers will be made at a suitable break in the event, but
                    admission
                    cannot always be guaranteed.</p>
                  <p>10.4 The event venue may conduct security searches of you and other patrons for safety and security
                    purposes and/or
                    may refuse admission to patrons (including you) breaching or suspected of breaching any terms and
                    conditions of the
                    event or any Event Partner.</p>
                  <p>10.5 Admission to all events is subject to the terms of admission of the relevant venue, and
                    certain items (e.g.
                    laser pens, mobile phones, dogs (except guide dogs) and patrons’ own food and drink) may be
                    prohibited. Please check
                    with the venue directly. The unauthorised use of photographic and/or recording equipment at events
                    may also be
                    prohibited. The use of drones or similar equipment for any reason in, at or near the event venue
                    without written
                    permission from the event partner is strictly prohibited.</p>
                  <p>10.6 Breach of any of venue terms and conditions or any unacceptable behaviour likely to cause
                    damage, nuisance or
                    injury shall entitle the Event Partner to eject you from the venue.</p>
                  <p>10.7 Event Partners reserve the right to refuse admission to the venue, or to remove any person
                    from the venue for
                    reasons of public safety, any unacceptable behaviour likely to cause damage, nuisance or injury, or
                    for any breach
                    of the Event Partners´ terms and conditions.</p>
                  <p>10.8 Unless expressly authorised by the relevant Event Partner, there will be no pass-outs or
                    re-admissions of any
                    kind.</p>
                  <p>10.9 By attending an event, you and other patrons understand and agree to being photographed,
                    filmed and/or
                    recorded in relation to the event and/or for safety and security, including filming by the police.
                    You and other
                    patrons understand and agree that resulting photographs, videos, audio recordings and/or audiovisual
                    recordings may
                    be used in any and all media for any purpose at any time throughout the world (however, you may
                    object to such use
                    by specific request to privacy@CarEvents.com).</p>
                  <p>10.10 Prolonged exposure to loud music or noise may damage your hearing and we advise you and all
                    patrons to wear
                    adequate ear protection at events.</p>
                  <p>10.11 Special effects, which may include sound, audio-visual, pyrotechnic effects or lighting
                    effects may be
                    featured at an event, which may not be suitable for those with photosensitive epilepsy, or similar
                    conditions.</p>

                  <p><strong>EVENT CANCELLATIONS AND ALTERATIONS</strong></p>
                  <p>11.1 If an event is cancelled, rescheduled or materially altered, we will use reasonable endeavours
                    to notify you
                    once we have received the relevant information and authorisation from our Event Partner. However, we
                    cannot
                    guarantee that you will be informed of such cancellation, rescheduling or alteration before the date
                    of the event.
                    It is your responsibility to ascertain whether an event has been cancelled, rescheduled or altered
                    and the date and
                    time of any rescheduled event.</p>
                  <p>11.2 Cancellation: If an event is cancelled altogether, we’ll usually just refund your tickets
                    automatically. We
                    refund the face value for each ticket – you’ll see a credit onto your card after we’ve emailed you
                    about the
                    cancellation with a timescale.</p>
                  <p>11.3 Rescheduling: If an event for which you have purchased Tickets or Packages is rescheduled,
                    Tickets and
                    Packages will usually be valid for the new date (or you will be offered Tickets or Packages of a
                    value corresponding
                    with your original Tickets or Packages for the rescheduled event, subject to availability). If the
                    date of an event
                    is changed, you may request a refund by emailing info@CarEvents.com. You must email at least 5 days
                    before the
                    event.</p>
                  <p>11.4 Material Alteration: If an event for which you have purchased Tickets or Packages is
                    “materially altered” (as
                    defined in clause 11.5 below), Tickets and Packages will usually be valid for the altered event (or
                    you will be
                    offered Tickets or Packages of a value corresponding with your original Tickets or Packages for the
                    altered event,
                    subject to availability). If you notify the event partner within the specified deadline that you do
                    not wish to
                    attend the altered event, you should be able to cancel your order and obtain a refund of the Sale
                    Price of your
                    Tickets or Packages (Service Charges and Order Processing Fees are non-refundable).</p>
                  <p>11.5 For the purposes of this Purchase Policy, a “material alteration” is a change (other than a
                    rescheduling)
                    which, in our and the relevant Event Partner’s reasonable opinion, makes the event materially
                    different to the event
                    that purchasers of Tickets, taken generally, could reasonably expect. In particular, please note
                    that the following
                    are not deemed to be “material alterations”: adverse weather conditions; changes of any advertised
                    event
                    contributor; changes to the line-up of any multi-performer event (such as a festival); curtailment
                    of the event
                    where the majority of an event is performed in full; and delays to the starting of the performance
                    of an event.</p>
                  <p>11.6 To claim a refund under clause 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4, please contact the event partner directly.
                  </p>
                  <p>11.7 Refunds will be made using the same means of payment as you used for the initial purchase.</p>

                  <p><strong>STATUTORY RIGHT TO CANCEL</strong></p>
                  <p>13.1 Tickets and Packages cannot be cancelled, exchanged or refunded after purchase, save in the
                    circumstances set
                    out in clause 11 or 12.</p>
                  <p>13.2 To meet the relevant cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your
                    communication concerning
                    your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period, as set out by the event partner
                    has expired.
                  </p>
                  <p>13.3 If you cancel a purchase under this clause 13, the event partner will generally reimburse to
                    you all payments
                    received from you in relation to the relevant cancelled event.</p>

                  <p><strong>INTERPRETATION</strong></p>
                  <p>14.1 The terms “including”, “include”, “in particular”, “e.g.” or any similar expression shall be

                    illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term
                    preceding those

                  <p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>

                    mean that we have
                    waived our right to do so.</p>
                  <p>18.2 We shall be entitled to assign our rights and obligations under this Purchase Policy provided
                    that your rights
                    are not adversely affected.</p>
                  <p>18.3 If any provision of this Purchase Policy is found by a competent court to be invalid or
                    unenforceable, that
                    provision shall be deemed to be omitted from this Purchase Policy and this shall not prevent the
                    other provisions
                    from continuing to remain in full force and operate separately.</p>
                  <p>18.4 If any provision of this Purchase Policy is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable
                    pursuant to the law
                    of any applicable jurisdiction, this shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or
                    enforceability in that

                    previous
                    sentence, this Purchase Policy does not create any right enforceable by any person who is not a
                    party to it but does
                    not affect any right or remedy that a third party has which exists or is available apart from the

                    of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>

                    this Purchase
                    Policy shall create, or be deemed to create, a partnership, joint venture, or establish a
                    relationship of principal
                    and agent.</p>
                  <p>18.7 Any notice provided under this Purchase Policy shall be delivered upon receipt and shall be
                    deemed to have

                    time of
                    transmission (if delivered by email).</p>
                  <p>18.8 This Purchase Policy shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with
                    English law and

                    to any dispute
